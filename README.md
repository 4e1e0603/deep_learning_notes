# Deep Learning Notes

This GitBook is meant to be a companion guide to Ian Goodfellow's textbook, _Deep Learning_. There is a chapter for each chapter of the original text. The purpose of this document is to organize a large body of images and links related to the content of _Deep Learning_, while also highlighting some of the most important concepts.

**Disclaimer**: none of the images are my own, and a lot of the text is slightly modified from the original. This is not meant to be an original body of work, but rather, a resource for readers.

**Note**: you may need to refresh each page upon loading, due to some outstanding `LaTex` issues.
